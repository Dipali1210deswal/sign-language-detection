# Sign Language Detection



## Objective:
The goal of this assignment is to design, implement, and evaluate a machine learning model
capable of detecting and recognizing sign language gestures from video input. This project will

help you understand the practical applications of computer vision, deep learning, and human-
computer interaction.



## Key Features:

1. Dataset Preparation: Collect or source a dataset of sign language gestures (e.g., ASL
alphabet). Annotate the dataset if necessary. Preprocess the data (e.g., resizing images,
normalization). here i have used dataset from kaggle(https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/datamunge/sign-language-mnist)
2. Model Training: Implement a deep learning model (e.g., CNN, RNN, or Transformer). Train
the model on the prepared dataset. Validate the model using appropriate metrics.

## Tools and technologies used:
1. Programming Language: Python
2. Libraries and Frameworks:
TensorFlow/Keras or PyTorch
OpenCV
NumPy, Pandas
Matplotlib, Seaborn
